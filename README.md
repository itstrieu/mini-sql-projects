# Mini SQL Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects designed to help me build key skills and understand essential concepts in SQL and database management. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems through schema design, query writing, and optimization.

Unlike with my Python projects, I aim to practice writing SQL queries entirely on my own. AI tools will only be used after completing my initial solutions to debug, optimize, or explore alternative approaches. This approach ensures I develop problem-solving and critical-thinking skills while mastering SQL fundamentals.

This repository reflects my commitment to learning through doing and showcases my journey toward becoming a more capable data professional.

### Projects in This Repository:
- **Project 1:** Health and Fitness Tracker

Each project has its own directory with a `README.md`, SQL scripts (`schema.sql`, `data.sql`, `queries.sql`), and documentation.
